# vehicle-health-prediction-model
Machine Learning project to predict vehicle health using sensor data like RPM, fuel pressure, and coolant levels

# ðŸš— Vehicle Health Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **health condition of vehicles** using sensor data such as engine RPM, fuel pressure, lubricant oil temperature, and coolant levels.  
The goal is to support **predictive maintenance** and detect potential issues before failure.

## ðŸ“Š Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaned & standardized sensor readings
   - Handled missing values and feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution analysis of engine RPM, fuel pressure, oil temperature, etc.
   - Correlation analysis for feature impact

3. **Model Development**
   - Trained multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
   - Best model achieved **66% accuracy**

4. **Feature Importance**
   - Engine RPM (35%)
   - Fuel Pressure (16%)
   - Lubricant Oil Temperature (14%)
   - Lubricant Oil Pressure (12%)
   - Coolant Pressure (11%)
   - Coolant Temperature (10%)

## ðŸ“Œ Results & Insights
- Vehicle health can be **moderately predicted** using available sensor data  
- **Engine RPM** is the most critical factor  
- Improvements possible with:
  - Larger dataset  
  - Handling class imbalance  
  - Advanced models (e.g., deep learning)
